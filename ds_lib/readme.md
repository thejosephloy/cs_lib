# Data Structures
The goal is to implement the major datastructures in C, C++, and Python. I want to come up with generic versions in C and C++, and simple versions using Python. Furthermore, I intend to implement reference versions that are easy to read, and performance versions that are meant to run as fast as possible and use the least amount of space. This is purely to test my abilities and document the cool data strucutres and algorithms I have come across so far.
